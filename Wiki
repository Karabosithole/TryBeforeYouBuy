# Virtual Try-On

## Overview
Virtual Try-On is an innovative application designed to enhance the online shopping experience by allowing users to virtually try on clothing items using 3D modeling and augmented reality technology. This project aims to reduce return rates and improve customer satisfaction by providing a realistic visualization of how clothing will fit users.

## Features
- **3D Virtual Try-On**: Allows users to see how different clothing items fit their body shape in real-time.
- **Clothing Catalog**: A comprehensive list of clothing items available for virtual try-on, including descriptions and sizes.
- **Augmented Reality (AR) Mode**: Utilizes device cameras to provide a real-time view of how clothing looks on users.
- **Fit Recommendations**: Machine learning algorithms that suggest items based on user measurements and preferences.
- **Social Sharing**: Users can share their virtual try-on experiences with friends and family.
- **User Reviews**: Users can read and contribute reviews on clothing items.

## Technologies
- **Front-end**: React Native for cross-platform mobile development.
- **3D Modeling**: Three.js or Babylon.js for rendering 3D graphics.
- **AR Capabilities**: ARKit (iOS) and ARCore (Android) for augmented reality features.
- **Back-end**: Node.js with Express for server-side development.
- **Database**: MongoDB or Firebase for data storage.
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication.
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow.js for fit recommendations.

## User Stories
- **As a user**, I want to upload my measurements so that I can see how clothing will fit me.
- **As a user**, I want to browse a catalog of clothing items to find styles I like.
- **As a user**, I want to try on clothes using my camera to see how they look on me.
- **As a user**, I want to share my virtual try-on images with friends for feedback.
